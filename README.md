# Web-scrapping-or-crawling
Reddit is one of the most popular social media platforms out there. 
It has communities called subreddits, for nearly every topic you can imagine. 
From programming to World of Warcraft, there is a community for everything on Reddit. 
All of these communities are quite active, and their members (on a side note: Reddit’s users are called Redditors)share a lot of valuable information, 
opinions, and content. 
Reddit’s thriving communities are a great place to try out your web scraping abilities. 
You can also try scraping its subreddits for particular topics and figure out what its users say about it (and how often they discuss it). 
For example, you can scrape the subreddit r/webdev, where web development professionals and enthusiasts discuss the various aspects of this field. 
You can then scrap this subreddit for a particular topic (such as finding jobs).
This was just an example, and you can choose any subreddit and use it as your target.

1. Used PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) and Pushshift to scrape Reddit for content analysis.
2. Scraped data is formatted for readability.
